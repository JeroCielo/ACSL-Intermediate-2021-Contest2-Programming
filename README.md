# Problem:
The Fibonacci sequence can start with any two non-negative integers and every term after that is
the sum of the two previous numbers. Therefore, if the first two numbers are 3 and 7, the
sequence is 3, 7, 10, 17, 27, ... A Fibonacci cypher uses these numbers and an inputted ‘key’ (a
lower-case letter in the alphabet) to encode a message into a series of numbers. Another person
can decipher the message by knowing the ‘key’ that was used and the starting 2 numbers of the
sequence. For each character in the message, integers are generated by using the following
steps:



Find the Fibonacci number with the same index as the character (e.g. using the sequence
above, the 1st character uses the number 3 and the 5th character uses the number 27).



By using the inputted key, find a new letter that is offset by the Fibonacci number found
in Step 1. Wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary (e.g. if the key = ‘p’
and the Fibonacci number is 17, then the new letter is ‘g’).



Find the number for each letter in the encoded message by adding the ASCII code of the
character in the string to 3 times the ASCII code of the letter found in Step 2.
In order for the Fibonacci numbers to not become too large, every message will be encoded in
blocks of no more than 20 characters so the 21st character would use the first Fibonacci number
again as would the 41st. We guarantee the message will not be longer than 100 characters.
